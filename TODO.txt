TO DO:
- Add `game_wins` and `game_losses` and change wins and losses to `match_wins` and `match_losses`
- Change DateTime for match to string
- Choice: Should `removeteam`, `deleteteam` remove an existing team, or remove a player from the team?
- Point calculations
- Standings Generation
- Playoff bracket
    - !start playoffs (limit permissions) to create bracket, and begin playoffs
        - precondition: all regular season games must be complete (or tied due to no report given)
- !teaminfo/details <team name> to display to_s of team (!teamdetails)
- Make Team.to_s show team name and record. However, upon creation, a new teams' record should not print
- No Repeat Team Names
- Team Players:
    - Players cannot belong to more than one team at a time
    - Players can't be duplicated on one team
- Report score of game (!report/!result/!score)
- Permissions - who can do what, for each command and circumstance

Bugs:
- BUG-ish thing: commands can work without their number tag at the end of their names.
    ...This should either be trimmed or required as full.

Continuous:
- Add brief and description to all bot commands

Done:
- Create Team
    - Team members must be valid names in channel (i.e. nullidea#3117)
    - Create a role for the team, add members to the role
- Create Match (Changes expected)
- Team Plyers
    - Addplayers to team
        - Add associated role upon add
    - Remove players from team
        - Remove associated role
- List teams
- !myteam to display details of the invoker's team (name, teammates, record, points, place in standings)
- Delete Team
    - delete associated role

Reach/Low-priority goals:
- Revise the "date/time" feature/requirement of a match
- Team Captain (recognition and role)
- Add League class

    - leagues have multiple seasons
- Add Season class
    - Season has Teams, (Conferences, maybe?), and Matches
    - !nextseason/!newseason would start a new season with the same conferences/teams
        - Either pass conferences/teams individually, or pass previous season and pull all needed information
    - Point scoring - Wins worth x-points, Ties worth y-points, Losses worth 0 points
    - Match & Game WLTs
